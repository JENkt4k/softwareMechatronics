## Correctness
- Verified against Python built-ins (`sorted`, `bisect`).
- Graph algorithms compared with `scipy` and `networkx`.
- DP and Backtracking verified with small cases.

## Gaps
- No FFT or advanced number-theoretic algorithms yet.
- No GPU or parallel variants implemented.

## Future Work
- Implement A*, Floyd-Warshall, advanced DP.
- Integrate with CUDA/Numba for speedups.
- Wrap optimized C++/Rust implementations.
